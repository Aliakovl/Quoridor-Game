Quoridor is a strategy 9x9 board game that is easy to learn but challenging to master. The game is designed for 2-4 players and is perfect for friends looking to spend some quality time together.

## How to Play

Each player has a pawn that starts in the center of the board. The goal of the game is to move your pawn to the opposite side of the board before your opponents do. Players can also place walls to block their opponents' progress.

To move your pawn, you can either move one space in any direction or jump over an adjacent pawn. To place a wall, you can either place it horizontally or vertically, blocking your opponent's path.
